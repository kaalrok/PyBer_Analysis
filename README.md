# PyBer Analysis
The objective of this challenge is to create a summary DataFrame of the key metrics for the ride-sharing data by city type. And then use two new Pandas functions, pivot() and resample() with Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total fares for each week by city type. Finally, write a report on the results of the new analysis.

## Deliverable 1: A Summary Ride-sharing DataFrame by City Type
For the first deliverable, we are using the Pandas groupby() function with the count() and sum() methods on DataFrame columns to get the total number of rides, drivers, and farers for each city type. Then using some data to calculate the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type. Finally, add this data to a new DataFrame and format the columns.

### Analysis
    - The total number of rides for each city type is  
    - The total number of drivers for each city type is  
​    - The sum of the fares for each city type is  
​    - The average fare per ride for each city type is  
    - The average fare per driver for each city type is  
    - A PyBer summary DataFrame is created. 
    - The PyBer summary DataFrame is formatted as shown in the example. 


## Deliverable 2: A Multiple-line Chart of Total Fares for each City Type
For the second deliverable we will create a multiple-line graph using he Matplotlib "fivethirtyeight" graph style that shows the total fares for each week by city type.



## Deliverable 3: Written Report for the PyBer Analysis
